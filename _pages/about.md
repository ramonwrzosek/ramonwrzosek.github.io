Hi! I'm Ramon. I'm passionate about learning, exploring the world, and sharing with others what I've learned. I spent four amazing years at NYU Abu Dhabi, in the Emirates, completing my B.Sc. in Physics. Currently, I'm a PhD student at Rice University. My research is focused on studying protoplanetary disks and the ways water is distributed within them.

Please feel free to check my [projects](https://ramonwrzosek.github.io/projects), where I'll be sharing my research, previous work, and some of the pictures I take in my free time. I'm a strong believer in the power of education, and I love when I help my students reach the 'aha!' moment. Therefore, I'll also include explanations to different subjects I find interesting, in an effort to help others reach a better understanding with different levels of complexity.

Let me know if they are useful, constructive feedback is always welcome!
