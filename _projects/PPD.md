Protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are the places where planets are formed. Imagine our Solar system but in its early/baby stages. These disks are found around young stars which are also in their initial stages of formation, thus we sometimes call them young stellar objects (YSOs). In the image below you can see the PPD around the young star HL Tauri (HL Tau). You can see different structures like multiple dark gaps, and disks that go from dark red to bright yellow colors.

In science we often use color to represent the intensity/strength  of something (e.g. light, magnetic fields, temperature) instead of the actual physical color of the object. Just like a topographic map indicates height by the density of contour lines, the image of HL Tau above uses the color scheme to show how strong the intensity of light is in different parts of the disk. One might be a bit disappointed  that this is not a 'real' image like what you would see with your own eyes through a backyard telescope, or like the wonderful images from the Hubble telescope. However, these 'false color' images are showing us real information that actually exists. The same way that looking out of a plane window you don't see any contour lines on the ground, looking out of a spaceship we would not see HL Tau's disk with those colors. Nevertheless, these methods are still very useful ways to represent data in a visual form. 

`So if the image of HL Tau above is not telling me what my eyes would see, then what is it telling me?` 

Given that astronomers rarely get to touch or be close to the objects we study, we make use of very ingenious  ways to learn about the universe just by looking at the light that arrives to our telescopes. In the case of the image above, the light was captured by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This telescope doesn't look like any backyard telescope you might have seen, neither like the Hubble nor Webb telescopes. This is because it is composed of more than 60 separate antennas that work together as a single telescope through the fascinating process of interferometry (more on that later).
The HL Tau image taken by ALMA is telling you the intensity of light within very particular wavelength range: ~1 mm (that's around the size of a pencil tip, or the thickness of a penny). That means the yellower the region looks, the more ~1 mm light we received from that region. The dark red regions indicate we got less ~1 mm light, and the dark bands mean practically no ~1 mm emission.

The intensity of ~1 mm light by itself is not really elucidating, so why do we care about it? Well, it just so happens that there are tiny particles of dust that are millimeter sized, and these particles emit light in the millimeter wavelengths when they are heated up. Therefore, the intensity of 1 mm light shown in the HL Tau image can help us estimate how much millimeter sized dust is present in those regions.

`Cool! Then the central yellow region has a lot of dust and the dark bands don't have anything?`

Yes and no. The intensity of light does not depend only on the amount of material that emits that light. It also depends on how much light is emitted by each single particle of that material (which in turn depends on the temperature of the particles). The same way you can have one single light bulb illuminating a room, you can also have many smaller LED's that produce the same intensity of light. When you are inside the room it is easy to tell them apart. But when you are far away, in astronomical distances, you only see the intensity of light and not the individual particles that emit it. Therefore, the central yellow region probably has more dust at the right temperature than the dark bands.  However, maybe those dark bands actually have more dust, but we can't see it at 1 mm because the dust particles don't have the right temperature. Not having in situ access to our objects of study makes things much harder for astronomers. Nevertheless, we keep coming up with new ways to keep learning and exploring!

Nowadays the HL Tau image above might not seem as impressive, but at the time of release it was one of the bests images we had of a PPD. This image confirmed the presence of gaps in these disks, which at the time were thought to be caused by planets that cleared out those orbits. When I was younger, hearing about this was very exciting and it made me want to learn more about space and planet formation. I remember I had this image of ALMA on my desktop, and now I can't believe that I get to work with data from this telescope (I still need to visit the telescope in Chile, but that's a plan for the future!).
