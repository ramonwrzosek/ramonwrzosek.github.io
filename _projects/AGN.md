Black Holes and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)

I began my research on Black Holes and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in 2019 while I was an undergraduate. Prof. Gelfand, from out Physics department, invited us to a radio astronomy workshop and I became fascinated by this new way of obtaining data from the Universe. Both backyard telescope and the Hubble space telescope capture light in the visible/optical wavelenghts (measured in nanometers). This is the same kind of light that we can see with our own eyes. In contrast, radio telescopes capture light in the radio wavelenghts (measured in meters and centimeters). It turns out that there is a lot of information out there that we can't see with our eyes, but we can still detect with these instruments. Due to their very large distances, and the physical processes going on within/around them, we need to use radio telescopes to have a more complete picture of black holes and AGN.

During the summer of 2019 I was very fortunate to participate in an internship at NYU's Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics. I worked with Prof. Gelfand reducing and analysing radio data from the NEP VLBA Deep field Survey. Achieved a sample of 12 AGN detections from the available 127 phase centers, with 1.5 Î¼Jy rms sensitivity. Coming back to Abu Dhabi I continued this research with multiwavelength analysis of the radio (JVLA 3GHz), infrared (WISE), and optical counterparts (SDSS) of the 127 targets. This work later became my senior thesis / Capstone project: <a href="https://archivesspace.nyuad.nyu.edu/repositories/2/archival_objects/28177">`Radio Quiet AGN in the North Ecliptic Pole`</a>. In this thesis we found that a correlation between the radio/IR emissions and the physical properties of the AGN and their host galaxies. A ratio of 1-to-1 VLBA to JVLA flux densities indicates a compact source (parsec scale) produced the detected radio emission. Brightness temperatures (TB > 10^5 K) confirm an AGN is the main source of this emission. VLBA flux density lower than the JVLA flux density indicates the radio emission is distributed across the galaxy, in the kpc scale. These predictions agree with the IR colors classification of the WISE counterparts. 

Thanks to the experience I acquired with this project, I served as a co-author to the paper <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac8665">`Dependence of the Radio Emission on the Eddington Ratio of Radio-quiet Quasars`</a>, in which I contributed with the imaging and analysis of radio observations of supermassive black holes / quasars.
